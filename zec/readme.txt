ZEC adds a lot of pre-built military objects such as bunkers, bases and outposts that can be placed down and used in your missions. It is very simple to use, just pick a template and place it down! 

The mod only uses vanilla objects and requires no additional mods running on other clients or the server, anything placed using ZEC will remain after the addon is either disabled or removed. 


** How to find the ZEC templates in Eden/Zeus ** 
1. Press F2 to select the 'Compositions/Groups' menu. 
2. Click the 'Props' icon (yellow one, far right). 
3. Expand out the options to see the list of compositions. 


Click on the template you want to use and you'll be able to place it in your mission. There are a lot of different compositions to choose from!
